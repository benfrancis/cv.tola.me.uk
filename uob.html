<p>In 2009 I graduated with a 1st Class Honours in <a href="http://www.eece.bham.ac.uk/Default.aspx?tabid=174">MEng Computer Interactive Systems</a> from the <a href="http://www.eece.bham.ac.uk/">Department of Electrical, Electronic & Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/">University of Birmingham</a>.<p>

<p>My degree covered a wide range of topics from electronic & software engineering to cognitive psychology and project management.</p>

		<p>In my second year I lead a team of students to build an autonomous line-following robot to compete in an egg race at the department open day. Our team's robot was built from a PIC microchip, stepper motors and infra-red sensors. The project was delivered on time, using only 40% of the budget and the robot came second place in the race and was featured in the Birmingham Mail newspaper.</p>

		<p>In my third year I lead a multi-disciplinary, international group of ten students to design and build a "radio orienteering" system to locate several low power radio transmitters within a 2km radius with a budget of Â£750. The system we built included a custom built antenna, radio receiver and embedded Linux computer with a monochrome LCD screen, audio, buttons, memory card reader, GPS receiver and electronic compass running a custom-compiled Linux kernel and an interactive Python application.</p>

		<p>My final year project was an interactive 3D web application to visualise the colonisation of an artificial reef. I wrote the application using the Python programming language and Django web framework and used the emerging X3D standard for 3D graphics on the web. I worked in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.national-aquarium.co.uk/">National Marine Aquarium</a> and <a href="http://www.mba.ac.uk/">Marine Biological Association</a> and presented a paper on my project at the <a href="http://www.web3d2009.org/">2009 Web3D Symposium</a> in Darmstadt, Germany. My project won me the A.P. Jarvis prize for outstanding achievement in a final year project.</p>
